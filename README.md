Testing repo for graph algorithms.

Implemented two ways of determining the strongly connected components (SCCs) of a graph given its adjacency matrix in Matlab. SCCs are maximal sets such that there exist paths between each pair of nodes within a set. See page 20 of [the book](http://bookstore.siam.org/SE22/).

As a next step, consider implementing these operations in OpenCL.
